# OpenRefine for Social Science Data

You can find the website for this workshop [here](https://scipunimelb.github.io/2020-10-15-SCIPUniMelb-online/).
 
Have you ever downloaded publicly available data to use for an analysis, but the data has quite a few errors, or different ways of formatting dates, for example? Or maybe you combined a few smaller datasets into a bigger one, but the variable names and values are not quite consistent? Or perhaps you ran a survey and asked respondents [which suburb they live in using a free-text box](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/cassie-kozyrkov-9531919_data-datascience-statistics-activity-6689553264905601024-Il-s), and were amazed to see how many ways people spell “Footscray” in a rush?
 
[OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/) is a powerful free and open source tool for working with messy data: cleaning it and transforming it from one format into another. Why not use R or Python, you ask? Or why not Excel? Although these tools are all very useful in different settings, R or Python can take a while to master, whereas Excel makes it difficult to keep track of all of the steps you take to get your data in the right format so that you can reproduce it later.
 
In this session we will demonstrate how to use OpenRefine to effectively clean and format your data, while also automatically keeping track of any changes that you make. Importantly, OpenRefine does not modify your original dataset, and every step can be easily reversed. You can even save all steps you’ve taken and apply them to a different dataset with the click of a few buttons. Join us to learn how to save months of work and cleaning headaches from your data analysis pipeline!
